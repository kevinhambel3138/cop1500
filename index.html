<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> This is my very first attempt at creating a webpage using stright HTML
  instead of a UI like Dreamweaver. It is a work in progress and there will be more to come!

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p> I learned how to use a computer at the age of 4 and since then my fascination with technology has only continued to grow. To the dismay of my parents I would take apart anything I could get my hands on and occasionally would be able to put it all back together again without any left over components. I quickly realized I was a hardware guy due to the fact I never really understood coding but could read a schematic and probe for voltage before hitting middle school. I started my own computer repair business in my early teens and only stopped when removing viruses and teaching elderly people how to open their email became tedious. I enjoyed playing with circuits and always thought I would become an electrical engineer. However, my true passion has always been flight and I am slowly working my way to becoming a commercial pilot. Between that and a possible future degree in electrical engineering, I would like to one day work for Boeing or Lockheed Martin and design aviation/navigation systems and test them in the field.

<h2>Acidemics</h2>
<p> Highschool I was in all honors and AP classes and graduated with a 3.85 GPA. I recieved many certifications during that time including:
    <ul>
        <li>Adobe Certification</li>
        <li>Microsoft Office Certification</li>
        <li>A+ Cerification </li>
    </ul>
<p> Though I have not been a large participator in college life, I plan to change that once I transfer to a school with a degree program that suits my interests
